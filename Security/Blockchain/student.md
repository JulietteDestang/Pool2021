Ethereum is a blockchain protocol that introduce smart contracts into the blockchain world. Smart contracts are contracts but written by a developer using the language Solidity. Once that the smart contract has been wrote on the blockchain using a transaction it becomes immutable and cannot be modified. So smart contracts are basically a way to make contracts on blockchain that cannot be change.

But as every IT program, smart contracts have flaws which can be use by hackers in order to hack to contracts and change their conditions. 

So today and using the website [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com) we are going to introduce you to the hacking of Ethereum smart contracts.
# Challenges
## Deploy a contract
For this exercice you have to solve  [this challenge](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/warmup/deploy/).

The goal of this challenge is for you to setup the environment you need to solve the following exercices.

No worries if the actions you make with the platform are slow, since you are working on a blockchain, all transactions are verified (yes, even on a test network), thus taking a bit of time (rarely more than a few minutes, but donâ€™t hesitate to call a teacher if you have any doubt).
## Call me
[The following exercice](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/warmup/call-me/)  expects you to interact with a deployed challenge.
## Choose a nickname
[This challenge](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/warmup/nickname/)   is pretty similar to the previous one, but it lets you choose your Capture The Ether username.
## Guess the number
The real security begins !  [The following challenge](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/lotteries/guess-the-number/)  is a first example of a proper contract. Try to steal the ether contained in the contract.
## Guess the secret number
[This challenge](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/lotteries/guess-the-secret-number/)  will require you to write a small script, to, again, steal the ether contained in the contract.
## Assume ownership
[This challenge](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/miscellaneous/assume-ownership/) is a bit different from the previous challenges but it's very simple. The person that write this contract made a terrible mistake that could be serious in real life. 
Your job is to find this mistake and to use it.
