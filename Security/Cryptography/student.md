## Caesar
Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the secret message is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.

**For example with a shift of 4:**

> Alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
> Secret message: REBLOCHON
> Cipher message: VIFPSGLSR

But you can also shuffle the alphabet to create a more complex pattern and even remove letters so your alphabet will not be 26 letters long. 

**For example with still a shift of 4 but a shuffle alphabet:**

> Alphabet: ABCDEFLSPZWTXIURNVQ
> Secret message: REBLOCHON
> Cipher message: APFWOLHOB

Now that you know how Caesar cipher works, it's time for you to start your first challenge:
		
 ***Can you please help me ? I am Alexander the Great and I need your help to decrypt a letter from Caesar that one of my spy got. 
 To do this write a python script that takes a cipher message and display all the possible shift. Your script should avoid to touch a character that are not in the alphabet and ignore the case of letters. Here is the letter:***
